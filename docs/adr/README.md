# Architecture Decision Records

Each ADR records one significant decision: its context, the options weighed, the
choice, and the consequences. They're append-only — supersede rather than rewrite.

| # | Title | Status |
|---|---|---|
| [0002](0002-concurrent-report-ingestion.md) | Concurrent report ingestion | Accepted |
| [0004](0004-extraction-quality-enhancements.md) | Extraction quality enhancements (embeddings, GLiNER, doc-context, self-verify) | Accepted (retroactive) |
| [0005](0005-ioc-extraction-defang-robustness.md) | IoC extraction & defang robustness | Accepted (retroactive) |
| [0006](0006-multi-corpus-detection-ingestion.md) | Multi-corpus detection-rule ingestion | Accepted |
| [0007](0007-in-app-configuration-panel.md) | In-app configuration panel (keys + corpora) | Proposed |
| [0008](0008-detection-coverage-matrix.md) | Per-report detection-coverage matrix | Accepted |
| [0009](0009-stix-trust-and-provenance.md) | STIX trust & provenance (evidence labels, consensus, markings) | Accepted |

**Numbering notes**
- `0001` and `0003` are unused gaps (early informal decisions never filed).
- `0004` and `0005` were referenced in code (`ADR-004 P*`, `ADR-005`) before being
  filed; documented retroactively to match the implementation.
- The coverage matrix is **0008** — earlier drafts (and ADR-0006/0007) called it
  "ADR-0005"; that number belongs to IoC/defang robustness. References were repointed.

## Dependency sketch

```
0004 extraction quality ─┐
