# Changelog

All notable changes to CTIParsor are documented here. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); this project is pre-1.0 so
sections group by theme rather than strict semver.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Detection coverage matrix** (ADR-0008) — per-report ATT&CK techniques scored
  0–3 for *detection readiness* (not lab validation), in a tactic-column matrix at
  `/coverage/:jobId`.
- **Multi-corpus Sigma ingestion** (ADR-0006) — pluggable `RuleCorpusAdapter`,
  `SigmaAdapter`, a two-tier registry (committed public `detection_corpora.yaml` +
  gitignored private `detection_corpora.local.yaml`), a SQLite rule store, and a
  fork-safe corroboration score. Scripts: `sync_corpora.py`, `build_detection_index.py`.
- **In-app Settings panel** (ADR-0007 Slice 1) — list/add/remove corpora and rebuild
  the rule index from the UI (`/settings`).
- **Evidence labels** (ADR-0009) — every relationship carries `observed` / `reported`
  / `assessed` / `inferred` / `gap`, persisted, exposed on the API, emitted as
  `x_evidence_label` in STIX, and gating the review auto-accept.
- **Cross-model consensus** (ADR-0009, opt-in `ENABLE_CONSENSUS`) — re-runs
  relationship-bearing chunks through a second provider; agreement boosts confidence,
  single-model claims are downgraded.
- **STIX provenance & sharing markings** (ADR-0009) — every object stamped with a
  TLP (and optional PAP) marking and an authoring `Identity` (`created_by_ref`).
  Config: `STIX_TLP`, `STIX_AUTHOR_NAME`; per-job `tlp_level` / `pap_level`.
- **Docs** — `SECURITY.md`, `TESTING.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, an ADR index, and ADRs
  0004/0005/0008/0009.

### Changed
- New API routes: `/api/jobs/{id}/coverage`, `/api/detection-corpora`,
  `/api/settings/corpora*`.
- DB schema: `relationships.evidence_label`, `jobs.tlp_level` / `pap_level`,
  and `detection_rules` / `rule_techniques` tables (auto-migrated).
- New dependency: `PyYAML`.

### Security
- Documented the security model (`SECURITY.md`): prompt-injection handling, the
  localhost/CORS posture, secrets/data-at-rest, and the deliberate deferral of the
  LLM-keys settings panel until its security work lands.
